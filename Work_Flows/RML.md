# RML
Ready made libraries are a little special in the sense that the samples being multiplexed are pre-pooled when they are handed in to the facility. To facilitate Library Validation QC the pools need to be constructed in the LIMS system before recording the measurements. The RML workflow therefore begin with a pooling step (after reception control).
