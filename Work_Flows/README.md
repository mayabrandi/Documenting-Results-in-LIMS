# Workflows
The workflows describe how a sample moves through protocols in lims. A workflow is either active, pending or archived, and samples may only be assigned to active workflows. The active workflows are listed under configuration in the web interface (system administrators only). A workflow defines what kind of reception control, library prep and sequencing procedure a sample goes through. The samples are assigned to the appropriate workflows according to 1413 Sample Registration and the authorized system administrators maintains the sample workflow assignments after that (in case something would change, or samples need to be removed). Only system administrators can remove samples from workflows.
