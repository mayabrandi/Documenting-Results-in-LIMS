## Reception Control
In the record details view press Set missing reads. This will set the UDF Reads missing (M), on each sample. The number is in million reads (not read pairs), and is fetched from the cg database. The reads can only be fetched if the sample has a application tag assigned to the UDF Sequencing Analysis. If the sample is missing this UDF or if it has a application tag that is not yet added to the database, the script will give an error. If this happens, trouble shoot or ask the LIMS administrator or team leader lab for assistance. The samples should be left in this stage while correcting the errors.
