# Delivery and invoicing


All samples that have gone through the workflows in LIMS will end up in the Delivery and invoicing protocol. All samples are processed in the same way in this protocol, starting with Delivery.



## Delivery

When a sample has been delivered to customer this needs to be recorded in LIMS.

* In the "record details" view fill in the fields. 
* Proceed to the NEXT STEP

## Invoicing


Samples to be invoiced at the same time are added to the invoicing step from the queue view. Do not add samples that are not supposed to be on the same invoice.

* In the "record details" view fill in the fields.
* Press one of the three blue buttons depending on how to invoice the samples.
* After generating the invoice add the invoice information to the database according to the instructions in 1139 invoicing.
